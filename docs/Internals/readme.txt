Dxf2Svg Configuration Readme
============================
June 5, 2003

Dxf2Svg contains a small language that allows you to
configure all aspects of itself.

This directory contains most of the information required
to write a configuration file. In it you should find:
1) This file.
2) dxf2svg.syn a syntax highlighting file for Textpad.
Please read TextPad's help file for creating a new 
document class.
3) Sample.d2s a sample d2s file.
4) SALly Grammar.txt, a description of the SALly grammar.

Once you are familiar with these documents you will be
able to create your own configuration files to control
the process of converting DXF graphics to SVG.
